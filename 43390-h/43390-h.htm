<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SILVER DOLLAR.</div>

<div><img src="images/1_dropta.jpg" alt="drop T top" width="175" height="78" class="split" />
<img src="images/1_droptb.jpg" alt="drop T bottom" width="97" height="116" class="split" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AKE a cup of porridge,
Johnny, dear. It's too
cold to go to work without
something warm."</div>

<p>Johnny looked in the bowl which
stood on the hearth, near a few
smouldering brands, and shook his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
head as he answered,&mdash;"I'm not
very hungry, mother. There's only
enough for you and Ella."
Then without another word he
hurried away, for the factory bell
was ringing; and he knew that he
must not be late.</p>

<p>Poor little Johnny! How he
shivered as he shuffled along
that frosty December morning!
He could not pick up his feet, as
the boys say, and run; for his shoes
were much too large for him, and
the heels were so worn that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
only by shuffling that he could
keep them on his feet. He had
scarce a quarter of a mile to go; but
cold and hungry as the child was,
it seemed a long way to him. He
could not help wishing he were a
baby like Ella, and could lie in bed
all day, with his dead father's coat
thrown over him to keep him warm.</p>

<p>It was early yet; and few people
were stirring except the men,
women, and children who were
hurrying to enter the factory before
the bell ceased to toll. Johnny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hurried, too, for he remembered
the scolding he had received the
day before for being five minutes
too late, and was just crossing the
railroad track when his toe hit
against something, which he
stooped to pick up.</p>

<p>It was a silver dollar; but he
did not know it. He had never
seen one. He thought it was a
temperance medal, like what he
had seen strung around the boys'
necks.</p>

<p>His eyes shone with pleasure; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
had often wished for a medal, and
he determined that when he reached
the factory he would thread a piece
of yarn through the hole and wear
it outside his jacket.</p>

<p>The place where Johnny worked
was a stocking factory. His part
was to wind the skeins of yarn
upon the long spools, from which
the men and large boys wove it
into stockings.</p>

<p>He had forgotten about his
hunger now, and was tying a knot
in the string he had put through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the dollar, when a young woman
came toward him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He held up the medal, saying,
eagerly, "I found it."</p>

<p>"It's a dollar, a silver dollar,
Johnny."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" cried the boy;
"now I can have some new shoes.
I thought it was a Father Matthew's
medal; but I'd rather have a
dollar. Oh, I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>The woman looked in his pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
face, and couldn't help saying, as
she did so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you hungry, child?"</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"What did you have for breakfast?"</p>

<p>His lips quivered, but he knew
by her kind face that she was a
friend; and he told her the whole
story of his mother's long sickness;
and how they had grown poorer
and poorer, until there was nothing
now but what he earned.</p>

<p>"I knew Ella would be hungrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
than I," he said, looking the woman
full in the face with his clear blue
eyes; "and so I didn't take the
porridge."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute; you sha'n't go to
work so," was all she said; and then
she was off through the door, down
the long steps in a hurry.</p>

<p>He pulled his stool close to the
small wheel, on which was a large
skein of fine yarn, and began to
turn it with his foot, when the
woman came back, bringing a
small basket.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Johnny, eat this and this,"
giving him a buttered biscuit and a
piece of cold meat; "and carry the
rest home. There is enough for
you, your mother, and Ella, to have
a good dinner."</p>

<p>Poor Johnny was dumb with
astonishment. He could scarcely
realize that all this was for him;
but as the woman waited to see
him eat, he pulled the hard silver
dollar from his pocket and held it
out to her.</p>

<p>"No! no!" she exclaimed; "give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it to your mother. She'll know
what to do with it, I dare say."</p>

<p>That was a happy day for Johnny;
almost the happiest he had ever
known. He had begun it by giving
up his own comfort for that of his
mother and sister, and by-and-by
God sent him friends to care for
him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KIND FRIENDS.</div>

<img src="images/2_dropdb.jpg" alt="drop D bottom" width="92" height="128" class="split" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ONALD MILES was the
name of the Superintendent
of the stocking factory.
He had just married a young
wife, and brought her to live in one
of the new houses near the mill.
She was a Christian woman, who
tried to follow her Master, and do
good wherever she had opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
She took a class in the Sabbath
school, and told her husband she
meant to have some scholars from
the factory. Two or three times
she had noticed Johnny running
up the steps, and thought, "that
boy is too small for such work."
You can imagine, then, how she
felt when she heard his simple
story.</div>

<p>In the evening Johnny and his
mother were eagerly talking over
the various events and scenes of
the day when Mrs. Miles opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the door and presented herself
before them.</p>

<p>"I feel sure," she had said to her
husband, "that the child told me
the truth. His eyes were too honest
to deceive; but still I mean to
go this very day and see for myself.
Why, they have nothing to eat and
are on the very verge of starvation!"</p>

<p>"I wish, Johnny," Mrs. Talbot
was saying, "that the dollar was
ours; and then you should have a
pair of shoes; but it is not, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
must contrive some way to find the
owner."</p>

<p>The room was very poor, but
clean as hands could make it. On
the floor in the corner was a straw
bed, between the windows, a
long chest, and near the fire three
small wooden stools standing
before an old rickety table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miles soon convinced the
poor woman that she was a friend;
and, before the visit was ended, she
found that though one was very
poor, and the other comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rich, there was one tie which bound
them together,&mdash;they both loved
Christ, and looked forward to living
with him forever in heaven.</p>

<p>When she rose to go she said to
Johnny,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll take the dollar with me, and
ask my husband what shall be done
to find the owner, and I'll see about
the work for you right away.
Why," she added, with a smile,
"I can earn a dollar a day closing
socks; and I never was called smart
with my needle; so keep up good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
courage. Better days are coming
for us."</p>

<p>"But I've tried a great many times
to get work," answered the poor
woman, shaking her head. "They
always told me there was none."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miles gave her head a little
toss, as much as to say, "No one
need tell me that story." Then she
laughed as she exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, if I can't get work for you,
I'll bring you mine. You need it
more than I do. Now don't cry,&mdash;it
will hurt your eyes; but say your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
prayers and go to bed. I'll be sure
to come again soon."</p>

<p>When she shut the door, Mrs.
Talbot began to cry; but these were
happy tears, which brought relief
to her overburdened heart. Then
she said to Johnny,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us kneel down and thank
God for sending us such a friend."</p>

<p>"O mother!" exclaimed the boy,
when they arose from prayer;
"wasn't that bread and butter
nice? I never tasted anything so
good."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear; and when your father
was alive we had bread and
butter every day."</p>

<p>The next morning, when the little
boy went to his work, he looked
all about for his kind friend; but he
did not see her until he had been
dismissed for dinner. He was
passing along the sidewalk, when
he heard a tap on the window of a
house close by, and, looking up, he
saw Mrs. Miles beckoning to him.
She had a bundle rolled up in a
towel, which she told him to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his mother, and tell her she would
have company in the evening.</p>

<p>And true enough, just as Ella
was safely in bed, there was a
knock at the humble door, and
Mrs. Miles walked in, followed by
her husband.</p>

<p>Johnny had never seen this gentleman
except in the factory; and
then he looked very grave as he
talked with the men or with merchants
who came from the city.
Now it was very different. His
young wife had told him a pitiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
story about the widow; and he
came prepared to help her.</p>

<p>"So you were lucky to-day,
Johnny, and found a dollar," he
began, taking the silver piece from
his pocket. "I have made inquiries
for you, and can find no one
who claims it; so I think you may
keep it with a good conscience."</p>

<p>Johnny's eager face expressed
his thanks.</p>

<p>"What would you like to buy
with it?"</p>

<p>"A pair of shoes, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, come on to the shoe-store."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lady, with a
smile; "and while you are gone,
I'll give Mrs. Talbot a lesson in
closing the seams of the stockings."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEW BOOTS.</div>


<div><img src="images/3_dropaa.jpg" alt="drop A top" width="166" height="78" class="split" />
<img src="images/3_dropab.jpg" alt="drop A bottom" width="113" height="133" class="split" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />S they walked together
toward the store, Mr.
Miles became as much
interested in his young companion
as his wife could have wished. The
child discovered so much intelligence,
and had evidently been so
well trained, that the superintendent
fully agreed with Mrs. Miles,
that it was a pity he should not
have a chance to go to school.</div>

<div class='right'><span class='small'>Series II, vol. iii, p. 32.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When they reached the store, the
gentleman said, laughing,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Show us your best goods, now;
we want a pair of stout brogans,
such as you can warrant will turn
water."</p>

<p>"For him?" asked the merchant,
nodding his head toward Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yes, for him. You see he
needs them badly enough."</p>

<p>"Boots would be better."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Miles's eyes began to twinkle.
He had a happy thought; and so
he put Johnny's silver dollar, which
he had been twirling by the string,
into his vest pocket, and began to
examine carefully one pair after
another of the boots laid out for
him on the counter.</p>

<p>"This is a good pair," he said, at
last. "What is the price?"</p>

<p>"Three dollars. I'll warrant
those; they are custom made; but
they were too small for the child
whose mother ordered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>. I
should have charged her five if
they'd suited."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see they're first-rate
boots,&mdash;what, in the hose line, I
should call 'A, number one.' Now
I'll tell you what I propose. This
little fellow is the son of a widow,
who, when my wife found her, had
literally not one mouthful of food.
Just think of such destitution if you
can!&mdash;a good Christian, too; but
the death of her husband and her
own long sickness have exhausted
everything. I propose to give half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the price, and let you give the
other."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't afford that! Why,
I've taken off two dollars already."</p>

<p>"Look here, now," urged Mr.
Miles; "I'm going to start a subscription
for the benefit of the
widow. It would make your heart
ache to see how very destitute she
is of everything. I want your name
down, of course; I must have it.
So here goes,&mdash;'Allen Manning,
one dollar and a half.' There, you'll
be glad whenever you think of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
made a child happy and comfortable."</p>

<p>"Well, if you say so, I suppose I
must."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now I want your
wife to join with mine and just
make the widow's hovel a little
more tenantable. They'll work together
finely, I know. Mrs. Miles
says she is sure a little nourishing
food will do more for the poor soul
than a shop-full of medicine. You
see, the poor creature thinks herself
in a decline."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Manning tied up the bundle
and handed it to Johnny; and then
the two started off for home, the
boy having looked the thanks his
trembling lips refused to utter.</p>

<p>"Now, Johnny," said Mr. Miles,
"here's your medal; wear it around
your neck as long as you are a
truthful boy. When you tell your
first lie, bring it to me."</p>

<p>"I don't dare to tell lies, sir;
mother says God hates liars; but
'those that speak the truth are his
delight.'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true doctrine; and here
we are."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miles opened the door when
she heard her husband's voice, and
said, in a pleasant tone, and manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She learned the stitch in half
the time I did."</p>

<p>The proud husband tapped her
glowing cheek. I am sure he was
thinking what a darling little wife
he had. And when Johnny eagerly
related the story of the boots,
I know she thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is so like Donald; he has
such a noble heart."</p>

<p>"And I have the medal,&mdash;I mean
the dollar, too, mother. I'm to keep
it till I tell a lie."</p>

<p>"Which I hope will never happen,
dear. But did you thank our
good, generous friends? I have no
words to express my gratitude."</p>

<p>"Never mind for words, Mrs.
Talbot. Good-night."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SAD STORY.</div>


<div><img src="images/4_dropia.jpg" alt="drop I top" width="134" height="80" class="split" />
<img src="images/4_dropib.jpg" alt="drop I bottom" width="106" height="128" class="split" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />T was, indeed, time that
help should come to the
poor widow, for a cough
had fastened itself on her lungs,
which would soon have ended her
life. The room was damp and
chilly, and her clothing quite too
scant for winter. Mrs. Miles
would not wait till she had earned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
money to buy wood and clothing
and food.</div>

<p>"They would all freeze and
starve," she told the people where
she went begging. "I want to get
something to save their lives; and
then, when she is comfortable, the
woman can earn enough to support
her family."</p>

<p>In two weeks you would never
have known the room; the glass
was mended, and now the sun
shone in. There was a pretty, old-fashioned
bedstead, four nicely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
painted chairs, a table with leaves,
a tiny mirror, a patch spread, and
the cunningest little cooking-stove,
which kept the room beautifully
warm. At least, Johnny thought
so when he came dancing home
from his work.</p>

<p>Besides all this, Mrs. Miles had
procured from an old lady some
healing syrup, which had nearly
cured the troublesome cough; and
Mrs. Talbot could sew now very
well, without that terrible pain in
her side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>She told her dear friend one day,
that if she could only forget her
past trouble, she should be quite
happy,&mdash;happier than she had ever
expected to be again.</p>

<p>"You must tell me about your
troubles," Mrs. Miles said. And
one afternoon, when Johnny was at
work in the factory, and Ella was
taking her nap, Mrs. Talbot began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was married when I was only
seventeen, and went with my husband
to the western part of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
York State. He was a carpenter,
and could get good wages, which
supported us in great comfort.
Johnny was almost seven years old
when Dexter, that is, my husband,
told me he wanted to bring home
one of his workmen to live with us.
The man had no home, and, as he
did not think it right to spend his
evenings in a tavern, he was very
lonely. His name was Robert
Hardy, and he gave very little
trouble. He grew to be fond of
Johnny, and spent many leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hours in amusing him and making
him playthings.</p>

<p>"But one day he came home
sick; and for two weeks he never
left his bed. Dexter and I took all
the care of him. When he grew
better, he went away to his mother.
He sat by the fire thinking. I expected
he would thank us; but he
did not. He held Dexter's hand
like a vise; and he tried to say
good-by to me; but his voice
failed. I have never seen him
since. I feel sure he was grateful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The doctor had told him our care
saved his life.</p>

<p>"The very night he left, Dexter
grew delirious; he had stayed at
home with a cold for a week. The
doctor came again, and said he had
taken the fever.</p>

<p>"Oh, those were dreadful days!
He grew worse and worse, and I&mdash;it
breaks my heart when I think
that I had nursed a stranger, and
couldn't nurse my own husband&mdash;I
was lying on a bed in the same
room; and my little Ella lay beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
me. Every moan of Dexter's went
through my heart; and when he
died, all hope and joy died with
him. I cared for nothing. I remember
but little of those long,
weary months which followed. I
should have died but for the kindness
of my neighbors.</p>

<p>"The Rector visited me; but I
scarcely understood what he said.
When Dexter died, there were
three hundred dollars laid by in
the bank. Fifty of it went for his
funeral expenses and my mourning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and the rest went little by little, till
I had not a shilling left. Then
Johnny was taken sick. I hoped
he would die; I hoped we all should
die; but I began to think that I was
not prepared to follow my husband
to heaven. He loved his Saviour,
and I did not.</p>

<p>"I tried to pray. The Rector's
wife prayed with me, and led me to
Jesus. I learned to trust in him;
but I was wholly inexperienced,
and knew not how to earn a living
for myself and my little ones. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thought if I could only get home to
my parents that I should be happy;
but I had nothing left to pay my
expenses.</p>

<p>"One by one my pieces of furniture
were sold, and I was dependent
on charity for my daily food.
At last they raised the money to
pay my fare, and, with all I had in
the world packed in Dexter's chest,
I left the place where I had experienced
the greatest joy and the
greatest sorrow I had ever known.</p>

<p>"When I reached home I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
my father helpless from a paralytic
stroke, and mother worn out with
care of him. One of my friends
owned this old house, and offered
me the use of it. He said, as it was
near the factory, we could get work.
I might have done something, but
I took cold and was unable to sit
up. Afterward, when I inquired
again and again at the factory, I
was told that they had already
more applicants than they could
supply.</p>

<p>"At last Johnny got a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
there; but his wages were small,
and&mdash;and&mdash;unless you had found
us, I think we should really have
starved."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GOING TO SCHOOL.</div>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PRING came at last; and
then what delight Ella
felt in being allowed to
run out of doors, and play on the
new, fresh grass with the pussy
Mrs. Miles had given her!</div>

<p>Johnny was still in the factory;
and Mrs. Talbot worked away at
the hose, making a very comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
living. She could smile now at
Ella's cunning ways, and laugh
with Johnny at the news he
brought from the mill, after his
day's work was done.</p>

<p>He was in Mrs. Miles's class
in Sabbath school,&mdash;her best
scholar, she said. He had won
a prize already for obtaining two
new scholars; and what do you
think it was? Why, a new Bible
with clasps; and very proud he
was of it, too. Every Sabbath he
learned his verses in it,&mdash;putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the red ribbon-mark with great
care.</p>

<p>In the evening, Johnny read to
his mother while she sewed, and
now he was learning to write.</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbot made a copy on the
slate, and he wrote underneath, trying
to make every line better than
the last.</p>

<p>One day he came running home
from his work, his face looking very
bright and happy.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" he called
out; "I'm going to school! I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not going to work any more,&mdash;I
mean not all day. Mrs. Miles has
settled it! And O mother! I'm to
go there this evening for a big
bundle of clothes. She's made me
a jacket out of a coat of her husband's,
and that was what she
wanted my other jacket for. Oh!
oh! I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>"That is news!" exclaimed Mrs.
Talbot.</p>

<p>"I'm to be advanced," he added;
"she says so, and paid by the hour;
and I shall earn just as much working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
between schools as I do now.
O mother! isn't Mrs. Miles splendid?"</p>

<p>In the evening, Johnny went for
the bundle; and the lady accompanied
him home to see how the
new clothes fitted.</p>

<p>"It's my first trial," she said,
laughing; "and I'm very proud
to think that I've succeeded so
well."</p>

<p>Johnny turned round and round,
as directed, to show first the back,
then the shoulders and front.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I find I have a natural gift at
tailoring," cried Mrs. Miles. "I
shall throw up making hose, and
devote myself to my new calling.
Just see that sleeve, now! It looks
as well as if it were bought from a
fashionable store."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank
you," murmured the widow, laughing
through her tears. "I should
have tried to cut them over, of
course; but I'm afraid I should
have made a bungling piece of
work of it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, if you confess so
much, I will tell you that I have a
right to be proud; for the times
that jacket has been ripped and
sewed, and ripped and basted and
pressed, are beyond calculation. I
made a study of Mr. Miles's wedding-coat,
at last, particularly the
sleeves, and then I found out what
my trouble was. But the victory
was worth all the pains; so I don't
count the four days I spent on it
lost time."</p>

<p>"I mean to be very careful of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
new clothes," said Johnny, who
had been listening in open-mouthed
wonder.</p>

<p>They both laughed at his grave
tone; and then Mr. Miles came for
his wife; and they talked about the
Sabbath school.</p>

<p>"I want you, Mrs. Talbot, to do
my wife a favor," said the gentleman,
trying to look serious. "She
is desirous of having an infant class
in the Sabbath school, and wants
you for the teacher. Ella, she says,
is old enough to go with you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed the widow, in
great astonishment. "Me! Why,
I am not competent to teach any
one."</p>

<p>"Neither am I," urged Mrs.
Miles; "but I do love my Saviour;
and I want the boys and girls
around me to love him; so I try
to tell them what a good Being he
is, and what he has done for us.
Can't you do that?"</p>

<p>With a deepened color the widow
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At least, I will try."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you would; and if you
will only tell them the 'sweet story
of old,' as I heard you telling it to
Johnny one of the first visits I
made you, and while I was waiting
in the entry for you to answer my
knock, it is all I will ask. Ever
since that time I have only been
waiting for summer so that the little
ones, Ella among the rest, can
go out."</p>

<p>"She tells me beautiful stories
about Daniel in the lion's den,"
exclaimed Johnny; "and about
Joseph in prison. I can read them,
too, in my new Bible."</p>

<p>"There is a small vestry which
seems made on purpose for your
school," suggested Mr. Miles.</p>

<p>"Where we hope to see you next
Sabbath," added the lady.</p>

<p>"I will do the best I can," was the
humble reply; "and I am sure I

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JOHNNY A FAVORITE.</div>

<img src="images/4_dropib.jpg" alt="drop I bottom" width="106" height="128" class="split" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; WISH you could have
seen Johnny the first
morning he started for
school. His face was as clean as
soap and water could make it; his
hair was nicely parted on his broad
forehead; his eyes shone like stars;
and his mouth was wreathed with
smiles. He wore the new suit Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Miles had given him, and a clean
linen collar around his neck. In
one hand he carried a little pail full
of dinner; and under his other arm,
his spelling-book, reader, and slate.
He was to call at Mrs. Miles's for
a pencil; and so, after bidding his
mother good-by and hearing her
call after him, "Be a good lad,
Johnny, and don't let any idle boys
turn you from your book," he
hurried away to be in season to
choose a seat.</div>

<p>This was the first day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
term, and the earliest scholars had
the best chance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miles met him at the door
with the long slate-pencil nicely
sharpened in her hand; and, having
looked at him from head to foot,
she said, approvingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are just right, Johnny, and
I'm proud of you." Then she
kissed his glowing cheek, and he
ran down the steps.</p>

<p>I suppose you would like to know
where the silver dollar was all this
time. Why, round Johnny's neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to be sure! You know he was to
wear it till he told a lie; and, as he
had never departed from the truth,
it was still there, fastened to a nice
ribbon that his mother had bought
for it.</p>

<p>At school, Johnny liked his
teacher and the boys; and they
liked Johnny. In school he was
as grave as a judge, studying his
lessons with all his might; but at
recess there was not a merrier boy
among the whole set. Playing ball
or catcher were new games to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
who had always been obliged to
work so hard, and he enjoyed every
moment of the time given to them.</p>

<p>Then he was always fair at his
plays, and ready to oblige his companions.
By-and-by it used to be
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't cheat, now! Be fair, like
Johnny Talbot."</p>

<p>This pleased Johnny's friends
more than all the rest. To be sure
they liked to have him a good
scholar,&mdash;to have him popular
among his school-mates; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
best of all to know that he tried to
do what God would approve.</p>

<p>At home he was just the same
boy that he was when I first began
to tell you about him, and was as
ready to give up his pleasure to his
mother and Ella as he had been
to give up his scant breakfast of
Indian porridge, when he knew
there was not enough for all.</p>

<p>As you may imagine, Johnny
was a very busy child. He rose
almost as soon as he could see, and
reached the farm where his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and Mrs. Miles bought their milk,
before the farmer was ready for
him. Then he was back with his
two pails, and off for the factory
for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>He was very happy here, for all
the men and women smiled upon
him, so he whistled away at his
work, though the noise of the
machinery prevented any one but
himself hearing his music.</p>

<p>When the town-clock struck
eight he was off for home, where he
had only just time to eat his breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wash and dress for school,
before it was the hour to start.</p>

<p>After school, he changed his
clothes again, and had three more
hours for work before dark.</p>

<p>So the summer passed happily
away. Sometimes, indeed, when
the boys were starting off for nuts;
or when he heard them on the common,
flying their kites, he used to
wish, just for one moment, that he
were rich, so that he could have
time to go with them; but he did
not cherish such thoughts. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
knew that God had been very kind
to him, and that his heavenly Father
had ordered all things for his
best good. His mother had explained
to him that it was for
Joseph's future advancement that
God allowed him to be put into
prison, and that this great and
good Being is always watchful
over those who love and trust
him.</p>

<p>At home, though Johnny had
little leisure, yet he contrived to
please Ella so much that she longed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
for his presence, and would run
forth to meet him, her apron full
of grass and flowers, which she
had gathered for dear Johnny.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JOHNNY'S TRUST.</div>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Y the industry of Johnny,
and the wages of his kind
mother, the family at the
cottage had passed a very comfortable
summer; but now work was
scarce, and the widow looked forward
with some dread to the cold
weather.</div>

<p>She well knew that more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
one third of the women who
worked for the factory had received
no hose for several weeks;
and that it was only through her
friend's exertions that Mr. Miles
sent it regularly to her.</p>

<p>Then, although her earnings had
provided them with abundance of
good plain food, yet this sum, even
if continued, would not supply fuel
and warm clothes. Nor was there
anything to pay for mending the
roof, where the rain dripped in
during every shower.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a dreary November
evening that Mrs. Talbot talked
with her son while Ella, untroubled
by anxiety or care, lay soundly
sleeping in the bed at the farther
corner of the room.</p>

<p>With a sigh, the widow told her
boy she feared trouble was before
them.</p>

<p>"Everything seems dark," she
went on; "I can't see where help
to carry us through the winter
is coming from. We can't live in
this house much longer unless it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
has new shingles on the roof; and I
know that is a very costly job.
Then we all need warm clothes.
I'm afraid, Johnny, you'll have to
leave school and work harder than
you have ever worked before;" and
she sighed again.</p>

<p>Johnny's chin trembled. "I can't
work in the mill, mother," he began,
trying to keep back a sob. "One
of the men told me to-day there
were no orders from the merchants,
and they would have to stop."</p>

<p>The widow covered her pale face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
with her hands. "We shall starve,
then," she cried out, in a voice of
agony. "Oh, if your father were
only alive!"</p>

<p>She leaned on the table and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Mother," faltered Johnny, drawing
his coat-sleeve across his eyes;
"mother, you told me our heavenly
Father loves us better than any
earthly father. Won't he help us
if we pray to him? Don't cry so,
mother; I think he knows about it,
and perhaps he'll take care of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as he did when we were starving
before."</p>

<p>"Johnny! Johnny! I've been
wicked. I've been doubting him
all day. Yes, my child, he is good,
merciful, and true to his promises,
even to poor, weak creatures like
me. We will pray, and we will
trust. I feel happier already. I
have been carrying my burden of
care when he says we may cast it
on him. Come, Johnny, we will
pray."</p>

<p>They kneeled together by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
firelight; and the woman, with a
full heart, thanked her heavenly
Father for her precious boy,&mdash;that
his faith had not wavered when she
so wickedly doubted his power or
his willingness to help them. She
thanked him again for his former
care of them, and she urged his
gracious promise, "I will be the
widow's God, and a father to the
fatherless."</p>

<p>She arose and took her seat with
almost a smile.</p>

<p>"All my anxiety has gone," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
said, in a cheerful tone; "I know
my heavenly Father is able and
willing to help us. Johnny, my
precious boy, how could I murmur
when you and Ella are spared?"</p>

<p>"I prayed in my heart all the
way home," faltered the boy; "I
didn't know what we should do;
but I kept saying to myself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'God knows all about it,&mdash;just
as he did about Joseph in prison.'"</p>

<p>His mother drew him to her side,
and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>"Now you must go to bed," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
said. "Though we trust God for
the future, we must do all we can
to help ourselves. I have work for
another week; and you must be off
early to yours. When this fails, I
feel sure that we shall be provided
for somehow."</p>

<p>Johnny lay quiet on his couch,
and his mother thought him asleep.
She read chapter after chapter of
God's holy word, comforting herself
in his gracious promises, when
she was startled by hearing her
boy say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, there's my silver dollar,
you know. That will buy a good
deal."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled. She knew
how much he prized that dollar,
and how often Mr. Miles had asked
to see it, "to be sure," he said,
"that it was not lost or forfeited."
She resolved that not until everything
else had been sacrificed
should that dollar be parted with.</p>

<p>Two days later Johnny ran home
with the joyful announcement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Miles has come home!
I've seen her. She beckoned me
to go in, and, O mother! what do
you think she showed me? The
cunningest little baby I ever saw.
She wants you to come right over,
and she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbot interrupted him by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is good news! I'll go at
once, and take Ella, so that I can
stay and help her. Rake up the
fire as quickly as you can, and put
on Ella's hood."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I felt a little troubled for you,"
exclaimed the lady, when, after a
cordial embrace, she had heard a
confession of the widow's fears;
"but I am sure all will come out
right and bright. That dear
Johnny! I hope my boy will be
just like him;" and here she gave
the baby a good squeeze.</p>

<p>"If the mill is shut, as I suppose
it must be, we shall go to my father's
for the winter. It will be a
trial to all of us; but we will trust
it is for the best. My husband told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
me that he should know certainly
at the end of another week. If no
orders come in before that time,
they can't keep on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbot took the baby and
began to caress it to hide her
troubled face; but presently said,
with a smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How thankful we ought to be
that there is One who orders all
events in our lives, and that this
Being is he who calls himself our
Father."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JOHNNY'S NEW FATHER.</div>


<div><img src="images/1_dropta.jpg" alt="drop T top" width="175" height="78" class="split" />
<img src="images/1_droptb.jpg" alt="drop T bottom" width="97" height="116" class="split" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />HE cold weather came on
early this year. As he
ran shivering home from
school, Johnny saw, at almost every
house, the preparations for winter.
Here was a pile of wood, and there
a large heap of coal, suggestive of
warmth and comfort. Two days
more and the important question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
about the factory would be decided.
If Mrs. Miles went away, it would
be very desolate. God only knew
how they should be able to get
along.</div>

<p>He thought of all this one night
as he was returning from the factory,
and to comfort himself began
humming his favorite tune,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"I have a Father in the promised land."<br />
</div>

<p>As he came in sight of the cottage,
he wondered at the bright
light which reflected from the windows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but he wondered still more
at the scene presented within.</p>

<p>Their one table was set in the
middle of the floor, and spread with
such abundance as he had never
seen there. His mother was hurrying
to and fro, and intent on the
cakes she was frying, while at the
same time she talked with a well-dressed
man who sat near the fire
holding Ella in his lap.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten your favorite
dish," she said, with an arch
smile. "You liked rye fritters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
best, while Dexter preferred buckwheats."</p>

<p>"Ah, there is Johnny!" exclaimed
the stranger, holding out
his hand. "Don't you remember
me?"</p>

<p>It was, indeed, an old friend,&mdash;the
man who had been watched
and nursed by Mrs. Talbot and her
husband, and from whom she had
never since heard. He had spent
a week in searching for her, he
said; and now he meant to take
care of her and the children.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>After supper, he rocked Ella to
sleep, and then begged to hold her
awhile; for, he said, "I have something
to tell you."</p>

<p>"You know I had not fully recovered
when I went away," he
began. "I tried to thank you, but
I couldn't; my heart was too full.
I heard of Dexter's death, and felt
that I had lost a brother. The next
thing I did was to make a resolution
to be a brother to you and
yours. I worked hard and saved
every penny. Not that I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
money could pay you for your care
of me; but I felt that you might
need help.</p>

<p>"There," he added, holding out
a package, "is the first I earned.
I laid it aside for you."</p>

<p>The widow's face flushed as she
saw written on a corner of the
wrapper, "Two hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"I found a good place and succeeded
well. Every day I repeated
the prayer Johnny taught me on
my sick-bed, and God answered it.
I saw my need of a Saviour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
gladly accepted the one offered me
in the Bible. I wrote again and
again to you, sending my letters to
our old place; but I had no reply.
At last I grew too anxious to wait
longer, and, settling my business,
I set out to find you. I wish I had
started a year ago."</p>

<p>"God's time is the best time,"
murmured the widow, her eyes full
of tears.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hardy bade Johnny
bring the Bible, and they had reading
and prayers together.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Early as the widow rose the next
morning, their guest was up before
her, and on the roof examining the
building. In the course of the day
the leak was stopped, the broken
steps mended, and a new lock put
on the door.</p>

<p>Toward night he went out, but
soon returned with a wagon containing
a barrel of flour, two casks
of potatoes, beside sundry small
parcels. An hour later the wagon
came again with a neat bedstead,
mattress, and two stout blankets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and a whole web of cotton cloth for
sheets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbot clasped her hands on
her breast, saying to herself, "The
Lord has, indeed, appeared for me."
When she tried, with a broken
voice; to thank Mr. Hardy, he only
smiled as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a little. You'll find I'm
selfish after all."</p>

<p>They had a long talk that evening,
after the children were asleep,
which accounted perhaps for the
pretty pink in the widow's cheek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
when Johnny saw her the next
morning.</p>

<p>"Come here, my boy," said Mr.
Hardy, drawing a stool to his side;
"I loved your father. He was one
of the best men I ever knew. But
as he is gone, your mother last
night consented that I should be a
father to you and Ella. Will you
be my true and loving son?"</p>

<p>He opened his arms, and Johnny
was clasped to his breast.</p>

<p>"I will try to be a good son," he
whispered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mr. Hardy urged there was
no use in delay, the next Sabbath
morning they went to the Rector's
house and were married, Mr. Miles
giving the bride away.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hardy examined the
cottage, he did it with the resolution
to repair it, if it proved worth
the expense. But he found many
of the timbers rotten, and the sills
sunken into the ground. He
thought it better, therefore, to put
up a new house, for which he had
abundant means. He hired an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
barn, and fitted it up for a shop,
and then, when not otherwise engaged,
labored diligently at getting
out the frame, doors, and windows
for his new building.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEW HOUSE.</div>


<div><img src="images/1_dropta.jpg" alt="drop T top" width="175" height="78" class="split" />
<img src="images/1_droptb.jpg" alt="drop T bottom" width="97" height="116" class="split" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />HE factory was closed, but
only for a few weeks. Just
as Mr. Miles was making
preparation to leave, orders came
in, which obliged him to employ
all their old hands.</div>

<p>Johnny did not leave school, but
worked two hours in the morning,
as before. He did not work at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
night, because his new father insisted
that every boy must have
some time to play; and then, when
Mr. Hardy began to have more
work than he could do, Johnny
must get kindlings for his mother,
or run of errands for her.</p>

<p>In the spring the new house was
finished; a plain, neat building, with
a pretty portico over the front door.
Johnny and his mother often talked
about their old trials, and always
remembered with pleasure that in
the hour of their sorest need, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
did not forget to trust in the great
and good God.</p>

<p>Would you like to know what
kind of a house it was to be? I
will try to describe it as Mr. Hardy
did to Johnny and his mother one
evening, with Ella sitting on his
knee.</p>

<p>"There," he said, drawing a plan
on Johnny's slate, "is the front
door, which leads into the entry.
Out of this on one side is a room,
which we will call the Sunday-room;
because I shall, by and by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
have an organ in there, and we
will sing psalm tunes on Sunday."</p>

<p>Johnny gave a scream of delight,
and Ella asked, "May I sing, too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear. Now here
on the other side is the room where
we shall live and take our meals.
Behind the front entry is a large
closet, into which I mean to put
lockers and drawers, so that your
mother can keep her dishes nicely
arranged, as they used to be in her
old home. I remember," he added,
with a smiling glance at his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"how cosily the room used to look
when Dexter and I came home
from our work, and how I thought
I should be the happiest man living
if I had somebody to care for me as
you did for Dexter.</p>

<p>"Besides, there will be a kitchen
and a shed beyond, where you will
have a chance to cut and pile wood.
Ella must have some work, too, and
so here goes the chicken-house,
where she will have to feed the
biddies, and find the nice white
eggs. Upstairs, Johnny, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
will be four chambers, beside a tiny
room over the front entry."</p>

<p>"Mother is crying!" exclaimed
Ella, springing to the floor.</p>

<p>"It seems like a dream, a happy
dream," said Mrs. Hardy, softly.
"Only a few weeks ago, and we
were so destitute, and knew not
where to turn for help!"</p>

<p>"But we prayed to God, mother,
and he heard us. I guess that's
why he sent Mr. Hardy here, don't
you?"</p>
